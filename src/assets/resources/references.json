We are looking forward to seeing how the few kids that we got out of him do.\n\nHis dam is on the Elite Does list and has been on the ADGA Top Ten list 3 years. Steel is very dairy and so far, has put udders on his daughters. We are excited to mix his genetics into our farm.",

Although she was maturing into a decent doe, she hated being milked and shown, so when we needed to downsize our two-year-olds she was the first to go. She now lives on a pet farm with a family that is going to give her a life she enjoys.",
