  "homeDescription": "Welcome to **Lil’ Pilchuck Creek Farm**, located in the scenic *Granite Falls, WA*. What began as a family hobby with Nigerian Dwarf goats has evolved into a proud ADGA-registered farm that participates in Linear Appraisal and the DHIA milk test performance programs. Our journey started with 4-H, and over the years, we’ve expanded into ADGA-sanctioned shows.\n\nWe specialize in breeding Nigerian Dwarf goats that stand out for their exceptional milk production, gentle personalities, and outstanding conformation. Whether you’re looking for high-performing dairy goats or friendly companions, our herd is built on a foundation of integrity and care.\n![4 kids on dog bed](/uploads/1750737613934-0+.webp)\n![4 kids on dog bed plus Frost](/uploads/1750737613934-1+.webp)\n![4 kids on dog bed with Frost in the background](/uploads/1750737613934-2+.webp)\n![Beauty and her does looking through a door](/uploads/1750737613934-3+.webp)\n![3 kids and Sky looking through a door](/uploads/1750737613934-4+.webp)\n![3 kids looking through door](/uploads/1750737613934-5+.webp)\n![3 kids looking at camera through door](/uploads/1750737613934-6+.webp)",
