    "description": "We originally planned to breed Mystic to [Steel](/bucks/Steel) with hopes of improving her udder attachments. However, we took a closer look at his dam and realized that this might not be the right choice, as she is also a heavy producer and the last think we want is a doe producing even more than Mystic, but having the same lack of udder attachment. So, we've decided to try Steel's son, Magma, with the hope that he will introduce even more udder support, without necessarily increasing the production.",
